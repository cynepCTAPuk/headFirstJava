Now we’re going to dig deeper into the XML world support and for that we’re going
 to start by explaining as simple as possible all the subject-related initials.

In Java XML support we can find few API definitions, each one has its pros and cons.

• SAX: It is an event based parsing API, it provides a low level access,
 is memory efficient and faster than DOM since it doesn’t load the whole document tree
 in memory but it doesn’t provide support for navigation like the one provided by XPath,
 although it is more efficient it is harder to use too.

• DOM: It as model based parser that loads a tree structure document in memory, so we
 have the original elements order, we can navigate our document both directions,
 it provides an API for reading and writing, it offers XML manipulation and it is
 very easy to use although the price is high strain on memory resources.

• StAX: It offers the ease of DOM and the efficiency of SAX but it lacks of some
 functionality provided by DOM like XML manipulation and it only allows us to navigate the document forward.

• JAXB: It allows us to navigate the document in both directions, it is more efficient
 than DOM, it allows conversion from XML to java types and it supports XML manipulation
  but it can only parse a valid XML document.

You could still find some references to JAXP but last release of this project is from
 March 2013 and it is practically dead.
